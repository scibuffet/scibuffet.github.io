		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		Welcome to SciBuffet. We've scoured through the internet and gathered the 
		best <em>free</em> resources for studying <i>STEM: Science, Technology, Engineering, 
		and Mathematics</i> - including textbooks, lecture videos, courses and more! 

		Head over to the <a href='#'>library</a> to check out what
		we've got in store for you!

		<h1>Why though?</h1>
		Well, that's a long-ish story. Long story short: textbooks are pricy. Usually.
		We find the priceless ones (both literally and figuratively) from the unknown
		corners of the internet, and here, in one place, you can find all of them (that
		we've found so far).

		<h1>Can't I just look it up?</h1>
		The internet is HUGE! There's no shortage of material for every topic that you might
		want to learn. However, there is a shortage of free textbooks. When you search 
		on Google, the best resources don't always come up at the top. That's natural, 
		'cause Google doesn't really understand what's in any website. It ranks your
		search results based off of certain properties of the websites. 
		These properties don't necessarily ensure good content though. So 
		often you might be looking for a good, comprehensive, and free resource
		on some topic but you wouldn't find any. Not because there isn't any, but
		more likely because Google doesn't realise that it has what you're looking
		for.
